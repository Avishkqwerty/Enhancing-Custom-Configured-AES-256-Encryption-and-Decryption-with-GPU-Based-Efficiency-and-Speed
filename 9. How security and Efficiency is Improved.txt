##########The security factor is increased. ##########

*********KDF Section*********

1. The security of the KDF is improved using the input password and the salt (using the password and salt policy).

2. Using SHA 256

3. Shannon's entropy formula testing was performed (always the entropy level is higher than the existing KDFs, e.g., PBKDF2, bcrypt, Argon2, etc.).

4. The value of "N (CPU/memory cost factor) " is increasing, therefore higher.
The value of N provides better resistance against brute-force and other attacks.

5.HKDF is a well-regarded KDF that provides a secure way to derive keys from a master key or other input.


*********KDF + Salted Hashing + Encryption Section*********

1. Use of AES 256





##########Efficiency is increased. ##########

1. Key Expansion is Increased (HKDF is designed to support key expansion).

2. Flexibility is increased (HKDF is designed to support key expansion).

3. Use of parallel processing for the final device to decrease the time-consuming factor for the iterations
