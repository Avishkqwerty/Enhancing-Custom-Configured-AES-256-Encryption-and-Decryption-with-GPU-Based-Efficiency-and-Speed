Composition of 2 KDFs are sued in this component:

HKDF + Scrypt (Sequentially)
The process of concatenation is used in this mechanism

>>Factors effecting the time consumption of the concatenated KDFs:

Iteratioion Count;
Hardware Performance;
Hash fucntion;

>> Improved factors of using concatenated composition;

>Security;

*HKDF is a well-regarded KDF that provides a secure way 
to derive keys from a master key or other input. 
It offers cryptographic strength and supports different hash functions. 
By incorporating HKDF into the key derivation process, 
the overall security of the derived keys can be enhanced.

>Key Expansion;

*HKDF is designed to support key expansion, 
allowing a small amount of input material (e.g., a master key) 
to generate a larger set of keys. This can be useful when deriving 
multiple keys for various purposes, such as encryption keys, 
authentication keys, or session keys.

>Flexibility;

*HKDF is a flexible KDF that can accommodate different hash functions 
based on specific security requirements. It allows for the use of secure 
and widely accepted hash functions like SHA-256 or SHA-512, providing 
flexibility in adapting to different environments.

# n #

This parameter represents the CPU/memory cost factor. 
It should be a power of 2 and typically ranges from 2 to 2^20. 
A higher value increases the time and memory required to compute the derived key. 
A commonly used value is 16384 (2^14).

# r #

This parameter represents the block size. 
It should be a positive integer. A higher value increases the amount of memory required. 
A commonly used value is 8.

# p #

This parameter represents the parallelization factor. 
It should be a positive integer. 
A higher value increases the amount of parallelism and can be useful for multi-core systems. 
A commonly used value is 1.


Poosible values for r, p and n:

r=1, p=1, n=2
r=1, p=2, n=2
r=1, p=4, n=2
r=1, p=8, n=2
r=1, p=16, n=2
r=1, p=32, n=2
r=1, p=64, n=2
r=1, p=128, n=2
r=1, p=256, n=2
r=1, p=512, n=2
r=1, p=1024, n=2
r=1, p=2048, n=2
r=1, p=4096, n=2
r=1, p=8192, n=2
r=1, p=16384, n=2
r=2, p=1, n=2
r=4, p=1, n=2
r=8, p=1, n=2
r=16, p=1, n=2
r=32, p=1, n=2
r=64, p=1, n=2
r=128, p=1, n=2
r=256, p=1, n=2
r=512, p=1, n=2
r=1024, p=1, n=2
r=2048, p=1, n=2
r=4096, p=1, n=2
r=8192, p=1, n=2
r=16384, p=1, n=2
r=32768, p=1, n=2

These combinations ensure that r * p is less than 2**30 and n is a power of two greater than 1.
