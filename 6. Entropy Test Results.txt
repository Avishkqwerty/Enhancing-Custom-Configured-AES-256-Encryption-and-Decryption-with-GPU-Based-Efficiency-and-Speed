#CONCULUDED OUTPUT AFTER ENTROPY TEST#

Custom Derived Key Entropy:
The entropy of the custom derived key seems to be around 4.7 to 5.0, which indicates a reasonably high level of randomness and unpredictability in the key.
Higher entropy values are generally desirable, as they indicate that the key is more secure and less susceptible to various attacks.



Existing Derived Key 1 Entropy (hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac):
The entropy of the first existing derived key seems to range from around 4.75 to 4.9375.
These entropy values are also relatively high and suggest good randomness in the derived key.



Existing Derived Key 2 Entropy (scrypt.hash):
The entropy of the second existing derived key fluctuates around 4.8125.
This value is slightly lower than the previous two, indicating that this derived key might have slightly less randomness.




#FINAL CONCLUSION#

Based on the provided entropy values, we can make an assessment that the custom derived key is generally 
more secure than the existing derived keys (both key 1 and key 2). Higher entropy values indicate a higher 
degree of randomness and unpredictability in the keys, which is a desirable property for cryptographic keys.
